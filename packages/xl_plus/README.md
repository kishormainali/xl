## [pub.dev Listing](https://pub.dev/packages/xl_plus) | [API Doc](https://pub.dev/documentation/xl_plus/latest) | [GitHub](https://github.com/kishormainali/xl)


A package providing the `XL` stack widget to implement accelerometer- and  
pointer-fueled parallax animations that smoothly transform  
children according to a spatial, three-dimensional layer definition.  
Touch and Gyroscope support included.

Design simple or elaborate *`XL`*-erometer driven interactions and interfaces.

&nbsp;

## Getting Started
To get started with sensor data, use an `XL` with `XLayer`s:
 ```dart
const Widget xl = XL(layers: [XLayer(. . .), ...]);
 ```

To distinguish between pointer data (mouse/touch) and sensors data,  
employ `PLayer`s and the relevant flags:
 ```dart
const Widget xl = XL(
  sharesPointer = false, // default is true
  sharesSensors = false, // default is false
  layers: [
    PLayer(. . .), // ignores sensors
    PLayer(. . .), // ignores sensors
    XLayer(. . .), // ignores pointer
    ...
  ],
);
 ```

&nbsp;

## Layers
The `XL.layers` property takes a list of `XLayer`s or `PLayer`s.

These `layers` allow you to define the animatable properties 
of their `child` widgets.

> is the result of the below `Example`:

 ```dart
class Example extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(home: Scaffold(
      body: XL(
        layers: [
          XLayer(
            xRotation: 1.0,
            yRotation: 1.0,
            xOffset: 200,
            yOffset: 200,
            child: Center(
              child: Container(
                width: 250,
                height: 250,
                color: Colors.black,
          ))),
          XLayer(
            xRotation: 1.5,
            yRotation: 1.5,
            xOffset: 300,
            yOffset: 300,
            child: Center(
              child: Container(
                width: 200,
                height: 200,
                color: Colors.red,
          ))),
        ],
      ),
    ));
  }
}
 ```

&nbsp;

## Advanced Usage
As stated, an `XL` may have both varieties of layer interspersed.  
The default function of the stack is to apply *pointer* data to both  
varieties of `Layer`, and to only apply *sensors data* to `XLayer`s;  
there are, however, flags available to toggle either functionality, as:

```dart
const layers = [
  XLayer(/* Blue X Layer; reactive */),
  PLayer(/* Red P Layer; more reactive */),
  XLayer(/* Black Layer; non-reactive control */),
];

final example = Column(children: [
  Expanded(
    child: Row(children: [
      const Expanded(
        child: XL(
          // X and P Layers behave the same way with these flags
          // (but still may differ slightly on parameters for Z axis rotation).
          sharesPointer: true,
          sharesSensors: true,
          layers: layers,
      )),
      const Expanded(
        child: XL(
          // All Layers react to pointers, but only XLayers
          // will recognize sensors. Default flags.
          sharesPointer: true, // default
          sharesSensors: false, // default
          layers: layers,
  ))])),
  Expanded(
    child: Row(children: [
      const Expanded(
        child: XL(
          // All Layers react to sensors,
          // but only PLayers will recognize pointer.
          sharesPointer: false,
          sharesSensors: true,
          layers: layers,
      )),
      const Expanded(
        child: XL(
          // Each Layer will deal only with its prescribed input data.
          sharesPointer: false,
          sharesSensors: false,
          layers: layers,
  ))])),
]);
```

> 🟦 Blue layers are `XLayer`s and react primarily to sensors data.  
> 👆 The top two 🟦 `XLayer`s also consider pointer data
> 
> ⬛ Black layers are control `XLayer`s with *no animation properties*.
> They make no reaction to any input.

# Reference

## 🛣️ Roadmap
1. 🔳 Provide richer access to sensors data and ability to manipulate `Layer`s in new ways
   - Such as an `AccelSpec` and `GyroSpec` that would enable *transformation
   of* any axis based on *input from* any axis, determined by parameter.
     - Currently, for example, `yRotation` is controlled by accelerometer X axis
     rotation. `zRotation` may also be controlled by accelerometer X axis rotation
     with parameter `zRotationByX`. However, `zRotationByGyro` may interpret
     Z axis gyroscope rotations. It is the only axis with two such inputs.
     - Imagine declaring an axis to rotate or offset, then also determining
     which axis/sensor contributes to it. What deep options that could provide!
     Such as offsetting a `Widget` vertically *and* rotating it over Y axis
     based on only one input from accelerometer.
2. 🔳 Along with **#1** above, provide more Gyroscope functionality
than only one axis of influence. 
   - Gyro is a little tricker, as the sensor mostly reads flat near-`0`
values *unless the device is moving*.
   - This still provides cool options for developers to make neat interactions,
and so should be expanded upon.
3. ✅ ~~Offer an automatic `XL` stack that simply accepts a `List<Widget>`
(not necessarily `XLayer`s) and dynamically generates progressively greater
translation and rotation values for each layer.~~
   - Check out `AutoXL` which makes a parallax stack even easier to implement. \
   Simply provide any old widgets as `layers` and optionally tinker
   with the `depthFactor` or max layer `depth`.
   - Pre-configured: `AutoXL.pane`, `AutoXL.wiggler`, `AutoXL.deep`

&nbsp;

## 🐞 Bugs
1. Discrepancy with normalization delay and normalization duration.

&nbsp;

## 📜 History
*For posterity and developer preference, there are three extension "wrappers" available.*
- *Instead of the short, all-caps `XL`, consider a `ParallaxStack`*
- *Instead of the double-cap `XLayer`, consider an `AcceleraxLayer`*
- *Instead of the double-cap `PLayer`, consider a `ParallaxLayer`*

```dart
final xl = ParallaxStack( // XL
  sharesSensors: true, // same parameters and functionality
  layers: [
    AcceleraxLayer(. . .), // XLayer
    ParallaxLayer(. . .), // PLayer
  ],
);
```

##### WORK IN PROGRESS
- Furthermore, the [🌊 original website demo](https://xl.zaba.app/ 'the_wave website demo from package:mouse_parallax, converted to package:xl')
works well [with accelerometer data](https://github.com/Zabadam/xl/blob/master/website/lib/ 'the_wave website demo from package:mouse_parallax, converted to package:xl').


##### **Forked from [`mouse_parallax`](https://pub.dev/packages/mouse_parallax 'pub.dev package: mouse_parallax') considering the required `AnimatedParallaxStack` widget is not exported with the original package and that accelerometers have nothing to do with mice.**
- ##### [License here.](https://pub.dev/packages/mouse_parallax/license 'pub.dev package: mouse_parallax | license')
