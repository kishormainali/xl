  /// ### Sharing Input
  /// If this `XL` has both `XLayer`s *and* `PLayer`s, control the sharing of
  /// sensors or pointer data with the opposing `Layer` variety
  /// with the respective flags:
  /// - `sharesPointer` provides pointer data to [XLayer]s
  /// - `sharesSensors` provides sensors data to [PLayer]s
  ///
  /// ### Dragging
  /// A parameter class that primarily pertains to `PLayer`s and their
  /// parallax animation during an active drag or pointer hover event.
  ///
  /// ### Normalization
  /// A parameter class that primarily pertain to `XLayer`s
  /// for customizing the intake of `SensorEvent` data.
  /// - [Normalization.autocompensates], a flag for toggling autocompensation
  /// after steady sensor samples for some time
  /// - [Normalization.delay], how long to wait before kicking in
  /// autocompensation, considering `sensitivity` to past samples in a buffer
  ///

  /// The default [duration] and [curve] for this `XL`'s parallax animations
  /// are controlled with these properties.

  /// This applies when the [layers] are being transformed by sensor data
  /// or are resetting/autocompensating.
